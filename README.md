# Final project for the Artificial Intelligence course.


Laptops have become essential in our technology-driven world, especially in the post-pandemic era where prices have soared. Thus, determining the right price can be a challenge amidst the variety of available brands and models. To address this, we employ machine learning, specifically linear regression, to provide valuable insights. By exploring a dataset containing laptop information, we aim to build a predictive model that estimates laptop prices based on their features. The dataset comprises 19 columns, including features such as brand, processor type, RAM, storage capacity, and other specifications, along with their corresponding prices.

The process starts by understanding the dataset, exploring its columns, and gaining insights into the relationships between different features and laptop prices. We will preprocess the data by converting categorical variables into numerical representations and scaling the data if necessary. Subsequently, we will split the dataset into training and testing sets to accurately evaluate the performance of our model.

These insights benefit consumers in their purchasing decisions and assist manufacturers and retailers in setting competitive prices.
